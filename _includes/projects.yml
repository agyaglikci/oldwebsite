  quote: >
    In this paper, we show that it is possible to efficiently and scalably prevent RowHammer bit-flips 
    without knowledge of or modification to DRAM internals. To this end, we introduce BlockHammer, 
    a low-cost, effective, and easy-to-adopt RowHammer mitigation mechanism that prevents all RowHammer 
    bit-flips while overcoming the two key challenges: scalability with worsening RowHammer vulnerability 
    and compatibility with commodity DRAM chips. BlockHammer selectively throttles memory accesses that 
    may cause RowHammer bit-flips. To our knowledge, this is the first work that prevents RowHammer 
    bit-flips efficiently and scalably without knowledge of or modifications to DRAM internals.

  name: Revisiting RowHammer

  quote: >
    In this paper, we first present an experimental characterization of RowHammer
    on 1580 DRAM chips (408× DDR3, 652× DDR4, and 520× LPDDR4) from 300 DRAM
    modules (60× DDR3, 110× DDR4, and 130× LPDDR4) with RowHammer protection
    mechanisms disabled, spanning multiple different technology nodes from across
    each of the three major DRAM manufacturers. Our studies definitively show that
    newer DRAM chips are more vulnerable to RowHammer: as device feature size
    reduces, the number of activations needed to induce a RowHammer bit flip also
    reduces, to as few as 9.6k (4.8k to two rows each) in the most vulnerable chip
    we tested.

    This paper proposes Capacity-Latency-Reconfigurable DRAM (CLR-DRAM), a new
    DRAM architecture that enables dynamic capacity-latency trade-off at low cost.
    CLR-DRAM allows dynamic reconfiguration of any DRAM row to switch between
    two operating modes: 1) max-capacity mode, where every DRAM cell operates
    individually to achieve approximately the same storage density as a
    density-optimized commodity DRAM chip and 2) high-performance mode, where two
    adjacent DRAM cells in a DRAM row and their sense amplifiers are coupled to
    operate as a single low-latency logical cell driven by a single logical sense
    amplifier.

  name: SysScale

  quote: >
    In this paper, we propose a new multi-domain power management technique to
    improve the energy efficiency of mobile SoCs. SysScale is based on three key
    ideas. First, SysScale introduces an accurate algorithm to predict the
    performance (e.g., band- width and latency) demands of the three SoC domains.
    Second, SysScale uses a new DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling)
    mechanism to distribute the SoC power to each domain according to the
    predicted performance demands. Third, in addition to using a global DVFS
    mechanism, SysScale uses domain-specialized techniques to optimize the
    energy efficiency of each domain at different operating points.

    In this paper, we propose a flexible substrate (CROW) that enables new
    mechanisms for improving DRAM performance, energy efficiency, and reliability.
    We use this substrate to implement 1) a low-cost in-DRAM caching mechanism that
    lowers DRAM activation latency to frequently-accessed rows by 38% and 2) a
    mechanism that avoids the use of short-retention-time rows to mitigate the
    performance and energy overhead of DRAM refresh operations.

    To build an accurate model and provide insights into DRAM power consumption,
    we perform the first comprehensive experi- mental characterization of the
    power consumed by modern real- world DRAM modules. Our extensive
    characterization of 50 DDR3L DRAM modules from three major vendors yields four
    key new observations about DRAM power consumption that prior models cannot
    capture: (1) guard-bands in datasheets, (2) data dependency, (3) structural
    variation, and (4) misleading power reduction in datasheets.
