    In this paper, we propose a new multi-domain power management technique to
    improve the energy efficiency of mobile SoCs. SysScale is based on three key
    ideas. First, SysScale introduces an accurate algorithm to predict the
    performance (e.g., band- width and latency) demands of the three SoC domains.
    Second, SysScale uses a new DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling)
    mechanism to distribute the SoC power to each domain according to the
    predicted performance demands. Third, in addition to using a global DVFS
    mechanism, SysScale uses domain-specialized techniques to optimize the
    energy efficiency of each domain at different operating points.

    In this paper, we propose a flexible substrate (CROW) that enables new
    mechanisms for improving DRAM performance, energy efficiency, and reliability.
    We use this substrate to implement 1) a low-cost in-DRAM caching mechanism that
    lowers DRAM activation latency to frequently-accessed rows by 38% and 2) a
    mechanism that avoids the use of short-retention-time rows to mitigate the
    performance and energy overhead of DRAM refresh operations.

    To build an accurate model and provide insights into DRAM power consumption,
    we perform the first comprehensive experi- mental characterization of the
    power consumed by modern real- world DRAM modules. Our extensive
    characterization of 50 DDR3L DRAM modules from three major vendors yields four
    key new observations about DRAM power consumption that prior models cannot
    capture: (1) guard-bands in datasheets, (2) data dependency, (3) structural
    variation, and (4) misleading power reduction in datasheets.
