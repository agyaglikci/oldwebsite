    I enjoy doing cutting edge research at ETH Zürich as proudly a part of Safari Research Group.
    Please see my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=mt15O64AAAAJ) for the list of papers I participated.

    My responsibilities also include teaching tasks.
    We teach Digital Design and Computer Architecture.
    We give main courses to provide a strong foundation to hundreds of students.
    Also, we hold seminar courses that we discuss and analyze papers that are milestones or the state-of-the-art in computer architecture.
