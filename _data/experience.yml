    I enjoy doing cutting edge research at ETH Zürich as proudly a part of Safari Research Group.
    Please see my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=mt15O64AAAAJ) for the list of papers I participated.

    My responsibilities also include teaching tasks.
    We teach Digital Design and Computer Architecture.
    We give main courses to provide a strong foundation to hundreds of students.
    Also, we hold seminar courses where we analyze papers that are
    either milestones in computer architecture research or that propose the
    state-of-the-art methods and groundbreaking ideas.

    I have collaborated on two projects on DRAM characterization during my
    internship in CMU-SAFARI research group which are published in
    SIGMETRICS 2017 and 2018. In our SIGMETRICS'17 paper we characterize row
    activation and precharge latencies under reduced voltage operation.
    Our SIGMETRICS'18 paper proposes an accurate energy model for commodity DDR3
    DRAM devices.

    I worked as the teaching assistant of the following courses.
    Digital Logic Design. Course book is Mano’s Digital Design. Lab studies were
    some basic implementations of logic circuits by using Verilog HDL. At the end
    of semester each student implements a single cycle cpu with a predefined
    instruction set.
    Computer Architecture. Fundamentals of architecture has been taught based on
    Hennessy & Patterson. This course have some Verilog HDL implementation assignments
    for particular circuits such as ALU and Register File.
    Microprocessors. This course focuses on Assembly language programming to
    clarify the fundamental concepts of computer architecture. During lab studies,
    Intel 8086 ASM has been used. As another example for assembly languages,
    KASIRGA ASM ( ASM of our own CPU - KASIRGA ) is also used in course.

    I was employed for a particular project in which I developed an FPGA based data
    acquisition board for balancing machines. Both the design and implementation
    of FPGA and PCB was my job. I used Verilog HDL and Xilinx tools for FPGA and
    Altium Designer for PCB.
