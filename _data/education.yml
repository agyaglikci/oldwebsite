    I enjoyed my undergrad years in TOBB University, studying electrical engineering on an unofficial track of computer architecture that I pursued in the rest of my career.
    I also completed several projects in robotics, airplane design, autopilot design of UAVs, system design of a distributed motion sensor network, and an FPGA-based data acquisition card for balancing machines.
    I've interned with three companies for a total of 11.5 months, and worked part-time with one company during my undergrad.
